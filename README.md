# Scalelite Docker-Compose

This is a docker-compose project for Scalelite, which is a load balancer for BigBlueButton.

This fork of [
Jesus Federicos docker-compose](https://github.com/jfederico/scalelite-run) project was made to be able to use the scripts together with Ansible. Also it reduces the manual work a little bit.

The manual is available on [Scalelite lazy deployment](https://medium.com/@jesusfederico_39370/scalelite-lazy-deployment-745a7be849f6).
